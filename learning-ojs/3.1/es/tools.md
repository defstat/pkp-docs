## Generador de informes

The Report Generator page provides access to a variety of reports from your journal.

The system generates reports that track the details associated with site usage and submissions over a given period of time. Reports are generated in CSV format which requires a spreadsheet application to view.

- **PKP Usage Statistics Report**: Provides basic usage statistics for your journal.
- **View Report**: Provides a report on galley and abstract views by readers \(i.e., how many times a PDF for an article has been viewed\).
- **Articles Report**: Provides a spreadsheet of all published articles.
- **COUNTER Reports**: Provides COUNTER data.
- **Subscriptions Report**: Provides a spreadsheet of subscription activity.
- **Review Report**: Provides a spreadsheet of all review activity.
