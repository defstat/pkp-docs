Submissions to the journal that are assigned to a Section Editor appear in that Section Editor's **Submissions In Review** or **In Editing** queue. Section Editors will have received an email from the Editor requesting that you take on this submission.

Section Editors have access to only those submissions to which they have been assigned. Depending on the journal's policies, Section Editors may be responsible for just the Review of the submission or for both the Review and the Editing of the Submission.

Click on the **1 In Review link** to see the submissions assigned to you that are currently going through the review process.

On the resulting page, you will see a list of all submissions in your Review queue.
