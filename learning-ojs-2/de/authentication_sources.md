# Authentication Sources

By default, OJS authenticates users against its internal database. It is possible, however, to use other methods of authentication, such as LDAP. Additional authentication sources are implemented as OJS plugins; refer to the documentation shipped with each plugin for details.

To access authentication settings, click the **Authentication Sources** link from the Site Administration page; you will be presented with the following options.

By default only the OJS User Database is listed. To add a new source, choose one from the drop-down menu and click the Create button. You will then be asked to configure the source.
