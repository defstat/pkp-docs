# Chapter 11: Layout Editors

Layout editing is another role that can be configured in different ways. A journal may have the Section Editor or Copyeditor do the layout editing, or assign a separate Layout Editor. The journal must be configured by the Journal Manager in [Step 4: Managing the Journal](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs-2/en/step_four_management) to accommodate a separate Layout Editor.

The Layout Editor uses the final copyedited version of the submission to create the PDF, HTML or EPUB formats of the published articles and makes sure they have a common look and feel. These formatted versions are known as the galleys, or galley proofs.

If the option for a separate Layout Editor has been configured, the Layout Editor will receive an email request from the Copyeditor or the Section Editor requesting the layout of a submission that has been through the copyedit stage. A Layout Editor who is unable to do the Layout simply responds by email to the Section Editor.
