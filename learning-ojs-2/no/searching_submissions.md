# Searching Submissions

As an Editor you can search through all submissions from your Editor Home page. Between your Submissions queues and your Issues options is a comprehensive search field: you can use it to search against a submission title, or against any user associated with the submission; you can also use it to search for submissions that were submitted, copyedited, layout edited, or proofread between any given date range.
