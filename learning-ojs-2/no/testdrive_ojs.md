# Test-Drive OJS

New journals using OJS should use [OJS 3](/learning-ojs/), as OJS 2 retired and not recommended for ongoing use.

A demonstration journal using OJS 2.4.8 is available at [https://demo.publicknowledgeproject.org/ojs2/demo/index.php/demojournal](https://demo.publicknowledgeproject.org/ojs2/demo/index.php/demojournal).

Users of OJS 2 can test the software – as a Journal Manager, Editor, or a Reviewer – at a second demonstration journal site that has been set up at [https://demo.publicknowledgeproject.org/ojs2/testdrive/](https://demo.publicknowledgeproject.org/ojs2/testdrive/).

Log in with username: **admin** and password: **testdrive**, and select one of the available roles in the editorial process, and explore how it operates.

Also feel free to submit a test manuscript to see what authors experience, or assign submissions to reviewers, and log in as an assigned reviewer.
