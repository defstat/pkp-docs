# Active Submissions

This page will list any of your submissions to the journal that are still in process and are either complete or incomplete (in which case you can return and finish the submission at any point).

Each completed submission will fall into one of the following categories:

* **Awaiting Assignment**: the submission has been completed by you; you can no longer delete the submission from the system yourself. The Editor can now see the submission, and must assign an Editor or Section Editor to it.

* **Queued for Review**: the submission has been vetted and is now in the review process. You should receive notice shortly on the review decision.

* **Queued for Editing**: the submission has completed the review process and been accepted for publication; it will now make its way through the system's copyediting, layout editing and proofreading processes.

In the example below, there is one submission in process and it is awaiting assignment. The journal is only charging a fee to fasttrack submission. If a journal does not charge submission fees of any kind, this link will not appear. The author must use the Pay link to proceed if fees are required.

As the author, you can click on the hyperlinked title of any listed submission and review it. Clicking a submission title will bring you to your submission's **Summary** page. From here, you could revise the title or abstract by clicking the Edit Metadata link. If the editor asks for revisions, you will upload the changes this way too (in the Review section of your submission).
