# Journal Management Pages

The Journal Management Pages allow Managers to configure the journal's web site, its policies, and workflow. The Journal Manager also has access to the journal's other management systems and advanced features, and can create new sections for the journal, edit the default set of emails the system uses, manage available reading tools, and see to journal statistics.

We'll start with the Five-Step Setup Process, found by selecting Setup.
