# The Files Browser

The Files Browser is an advanced feature that allows the files and directories associated with a journal to be viewed and manipulated directly. In addition to directories for article and issue files, you can also see any layout templates uploaded during the Journal Setup.

> **Note**  
> 
> The Files Browser does not currently allow access to the journal's `public`/ directory.

To access Files Browser, select the link from the Journal Management Pages.
