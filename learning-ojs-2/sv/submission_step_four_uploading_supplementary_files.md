# Submission Step Four: Uploading Supplementary Files

This step is optional. If you have any supplementary files, such as research instruments, data sets, etc., you may add them here. These files are also indexed by the author, identifying their relation to the submission, as well as their ownership. Supplementary Files can be uploaded in any file format and will be made available to readers in their original format.

* Locate the file you wish to submit and highlight it.

* Click Open on the Choose File window, which places the name of the file on this page.

* Click Upload on this page, which uploads the file from the computer to the journal's web site and renames it following the journal's conventions.

* Once the submission is uploaded, click **Save and Continue**.
