# Chapter 6: Authors

OJS exists to serve Authors as well as journals. Not only does OJS provide an easy-to-use submission process, it can collect and disseminate key information about Authors and their work across important research and citation databases, including [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.ca/), [PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), the [Directory of Open Access Journals](https://doaj.org/), and others.

As an Author, your tasks include submission; submitting revised copy; copyediting; and proofreading.

To make a submission, you must have a user account and be enrolled as an Author. User accounts can either be created by the Journal Manager or, if journal policies allow, you can register yourself.

Once you have an account, log in to the journal site and under **User Home** select the role of **Author**.
