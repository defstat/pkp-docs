# Submissions Summary Page

The Summary page contains several sections, including **Submission**, which displays the author name, submission title, original submission file, any supplementary files, the ability to add a supplementary file, the name of the submitter, the date submitted, the section the article is assigned to, the editor responsible for the submission, and the comments to the editor you made as part of your submission.
