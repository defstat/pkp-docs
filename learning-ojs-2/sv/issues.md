# Issues

As an Editor you have four issue-specific pages available: Create Issue, Notify Users, Future Issues, and Back Issues.

![Issues](images/chapter7/editor_21.png)

Only Editors can create issues and publish issues. Section Editors can add (schedule) submissions to an existing issue, but they cannot create an issue.

It is the Editor's responsibility to check that all edited material has been proofread by the Author and (optionally) by a Proofreader.

The Editor can arrange journal section and article order for each issue; can modify issue data like volume and number information, issue details and cover images, and so on.

The Editor is also the only one who may remove published material from a Table of Contents.

Finally, the Editor is the only person who can send out a notification email to all registered Readers, notifying them of a new issue.

> **Note**
> 
> Journal content can be published in bundled issues in traditional volume/number/year format, or can be published as soon as they are ready by adding finished submissions to the 'current' issue. See [Publication Scheduling](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs-2/en/step_four_management) at step 4.2 for more information on configuration options.

## Create Issue

To create an issue, you must select the Create Issue link. On the resulting page using the drop down menu, you will specify if you are creating a Current, Future or Back Issue.

![Issue](images/chapter7/editor_issue_1.png)

The Create Issue page has three sections: Identification, Access, and Cover.

### Identification

The issue needs to be identified with the appropriate numbers and/or title, depending on the option chosen in Publication Setup (e.g., Vol 2, No 5, 2008). While the system will prompt the Editor with the next issue each time an issue is created, the Editor can override these settings and enter a new set of numbers or a different year. You also have the opportunity to add a special title and description for the new issue.

### Access

If your journal has enabled subscriptions, you will next see an Access section, where you can set the status of the issue (open, subscription) and an open access date (if applicable).

### Cover

You can also upload a cover illustration for the journal, in the form of a .jpg, .png or .gif file. This file will be posted on the Table of Contents as a cover page. It will appear on the journal's homepage while the journal issue is Current, and can be clicked on to reach the Table of Contents for that issue. Once the issue is archived, the cover will remain available with the issue through the Table of Contents.

## Notify Users

Back at the Editor Home page, click the **Notify Users** link to send an email notification to users associated with your journal.

![Notify Users Email](images/chapter7/editor_issue_5.png)

Before sending the email, you can choose to have the email sent to all users associated with the journal, or optionally to a subset of those users, such as Readers; published Authors; Subscribers; etc. You can also opt to include the table of contents of an issue. Finally, you have one more chance to edit the prepared email template before it is sent.

## Future Issues

On the Editor Home page is the link to manage Future Issues.

![Future Issues link](images/chapter7/editor_issue_7.png)

The Future Issues are where the Editor schedules submissions that are to be published next and into the future. The Editor may wish to ensure that there are always two or three unpublished issues, which enables submissions to be scheduled over a couple of issues (for reasons of balance, for example). Once an issue is created, it appears in the Future Issues list. A planned special issue is another example of a future issue.

Every entry in the Future Issues list displays the issue title and as it was created by the Editor and as it will appear online; the number of items (edited submissions that have been scheduled with that particular issue; and a Delete option. clicking Delete will remove the issue from the Future Issues list, and all scheduled submissions will revert to their original unscheduled status (they will not be archived or deleted, nor will they be resubmitted for review: they will remain in Editing, but will have to be rescheduled).

### Table of Contents

Clicking on an issue title in the Future Issues list will take you the issue's Table of Contents, Issue Data and Preview Issue pages.

Clicking the Table of Contents link will display all submissions that have been scheduled against that issue, enveloped within their respective journal sections (e.g., Articles, Commentary, etc.). By default, journal sections are ordered as they have been ordered by the Journal Manager in the Journal Sections configuration pages; articles are ordered by the date they have been scheduled. You can reorganize the order of both the journal sections and the articles by clicking the up and down arrows next to each item or by single-clicking and dragging an element with your mouse.

Rearranging journal sections in one issue will not affect the order of already-published issues, and future issues will still default to the Journal Manager's prescribed order. After making changes, make sure to click the Save button at the bottom of the page.

![Table of Contents](images/chapter7/editor_issue_9.png)

Every submission entry in the Table of Contents displays the submission title as a link: clicking the link will take you to the submission's Summary, Review, Editing and History pages. There is also a checkbox you can check to remove the submission from that particular issue. Removing a submission from an issue will not delete or archive the submission: it will only 'deschedule' it, and you will have to reschedule it from its Editing page, or archive it from its Summary page.

The 'Proofed' column shows which submissions have had the Author sign off on the final galley copy via the Proofreading process. Your journal may not rely on proofreading online, but this is a handy check to see whether Authors have had a final say on how their work has been represented.

Finally, you have the **Publish Issue** button at the bottom of the unpublished Table of Contents. Clicking this will publish the issue, moving it from the Future Issues list to the Back Issues page and promoting it to Current status on the website. The issue will also be listed in the journal's Archives page.

### Issue Data

The Issue Data page allows you to edit any of the information you entered when creating an issue including Identification, Access and Cover information input during the create issue stage.

### Preview Issue

You can preview an issue layout and associated information by clicking the Preview Issue link. You should do this to double-check that the article and section orders looks okay, and that the issue data looks as it should.

## Back Issues

Back Issues can be accesses from the Editor Home page or from the Create Issue or Future Issue pages.

![Back Issue link](images/chapter7/editor_issue_15.png)

The Back Issues page lists issues that have already been published, including the Current issue. There are three differences between this page and the Future Issues page listing: this page shows the issues' publication dates; you can re-order back issues up and down (which will affect the order in which they are displayed in the Archives); and you can assign any of the published issues to be the Current issue by choosing from the dropdown menu near the bottom and pressing Record.

![Back Issues](images/chapter7/editor_issue_16.png)

This demo journal has one back issue created as an example. Clicking on any issue title in the Back Issues listing will bring you to that title's Table of Contents page, which is exactly the same as the Table of Contents available for Future Issues. Similarly, you also have access to the issue's Issue Data page. As the issue has already been published, you do not need -- or have -- a Preview Issue option.
