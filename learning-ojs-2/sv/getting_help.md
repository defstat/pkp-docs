# Getting Help

Please note that OJS 2 is no longer maintained or supported by PKP, but some resources are available.

## OJS 2 Resources

The Open Journal Systems platform has a help document that is contextually embedded within the application, with the relevant pages displayed depending on the page you are viewing. You can find this context-sensitive help by clicking the Journal Help link, typically located on the right navigation bar, within OJS 2.

You will find relevant documentation on our [Documentation Hub](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca) page. The [PKP School](http://pkpschool.sfu.ca/) offers self-paced courses for journal managers, editors, authors and reviewers, and many of these videos are also available on the [PKP YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/PublicKnowledgeProj/) page.

Our [support forum](https://forum.pkp.sfu.ca/) is a place you can search for past answers to questions. Please note that OJS 2 is no longer supported by the PKP team. The [old forum](http://wayback.archive-it.org/7100/20160819234652/https:/pkp.sfu.ca/support/forum/index.php) is also available as an archive.

Finally, the [OJS 2 Technical Reference](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/ojs-2-technical-reference/en/) is an excellent resource for developers that are still working with OJS 2.

These resources will introduce you to OJS 3 and how it is different from OJS 2:

- [OJS 3 Features Overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFkEj2kXd-0)
- [Setting up a Journal](https://pkpschool.sfu.ca/courses/setting-up-a-journal-in-ojs-3/) and [Editorial Workflow](https://pkpschool.sfu.ca/courses/editorial-workflow-in-ojs-3/) video tutorials in PKP School
- [Learning OJS 3 user guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/)
- [OJS 3 live demo site](https://demo.publicknowledgeproject.org/ojs3/testdrive)

You may need to seek professional support to upgrade your installation. This can usually be acquired from the service provider that hosts or maintains your software, such as the technical support team at your institution or a third-party hosting provider.

If you are unable to get the support you need from your service provider, we recommend you consider exploring alternative providers. Publishing support services may exist in your institution that can help you identify sources of help. Or you can seek support from commercial service providers, such as [PKP Publishing Services](https://pkpservices.sfu.ca/).
