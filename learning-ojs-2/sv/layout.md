# Layout

On the resulting page, you will see the layout version of the submission, which has been prepared by the Copyeditor according to the journal's standards. Click on the linked file name (e.g., 8-24-1-LE.DOCX) to download a copy of the file. You will need to use third party-software to prepare the galley files (e.g., Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Word or Open Office). Here, the Journal Manager has made a set of Layout and Reference Linking instructions and a Layout Template available to assist in properly formatting the files for publication.

Clicking on **Layout Instructions**, for example, will open the instructions set out by the Journal Manager.

Once you have created the HTML or PDF files, upload them as galleys using the file upload tool (e.g., 8-24-1-LE.pdf). Be sure to change the radio button to Galley.

OJS will identify the file type based on its suffix (e.g., PDF, HTML), as well as provide information on the file size, language (if your journal is multilingual), original file name, etc. The label is added automatically, and will appear as such on the journal's Table of Contents in association with the item published. You also have the option of manually labelling the file.

When uploading an HTML galley, the Edit screen provides additional information, including the option to upload a stylesheet (unique to the submission) or images.

You can upload more than one Galley Format file, view the proof or the file, delete files that have been uploaded, and edit information such as the file name.

If the Author has uploaded any Supplementary Files, such as data sets, they will already be in place. They will be published in the journal in their original file format by default, unless the journal has a special policy with regard to their preparation (as with Figures or illustrations). Even if the policy is to publish them in their original format, you may still wish to consult the files to ensure they are legible and to see whether they can be made to further conform to journal style and standards.

When you have completed uploading the galley files, use the **Complete** mail icon to generate an email message to the Section Editor.

![Send Email](images/chapter11/layout_11.png)

You will see a date has been entered under "complete" once the email has been sent.

You have now completed the first phase of layout editing and must now wait for the Author and Proofreader to make any necessary changes.
