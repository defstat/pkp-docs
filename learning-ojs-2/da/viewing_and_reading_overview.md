# Viewing and Reading Overview

By default, Open Journal Systems is installed with a very simple, functional user interface. This includes a top header, a top navigation bar, a series of navigation blocks to the right, and a main content block in the middle of the page.

PDFs can also be view in a full-screen mode, for a more present, uninterrupted reading experience.

Finally, it's worth noting that both HTML and PDF galleys can be read on mobile devices, without the need of any special apps (aside from a web browser, of course).

The OJS interface can be extensively customized by uploading new stylesheets at the site, journal, and article level, and by various other journal-specific customizations. For the advanced user, the underlying template system can also be modified. As open source software, you are free to customize OJS as you wish.
