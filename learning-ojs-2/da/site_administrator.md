# Chapter 4: Site Administrator

As part of installing OJS, you will have created a Site Administrator user account. When you log into OJS with that account you will have access to Site Administrator settings from your User Home page. You will be able to create new hosted journal instances; manage language support across your system; and perform other administrative functions.

To access Site Administration pages, log in as a Site Administrator and from your User Home Page, click the **Site Administrator** link.

Site Administration responsibilities fall into two categories: **Site Management** and **Administrative Functions**. The activities of both are described on the following pages.

More technical information about administering an OJS site, including upgrades, email, statistics, and importing and exporting, is available in the [Administrator's Guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/admin-guide/en/).
