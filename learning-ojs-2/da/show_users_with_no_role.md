# Show Users with No Role

Occasionally, you may end up with a user without a role. They may have been accidentally unenrolled by the Journal Manager (by using the Remove option described earlier). When this user logs in, they have no options to choose from. To find any "lost" users, select **Show Users with No Role** from the Journal Management Page under Users. From there you can re-enroll them with the journal.

In this example Nicole Bell was previously without a role, and will now be enrolled as an author.
