# Chapter 10: Copyeditors

A submission that has passed the review stage and been accepted by the Journal Editor or Section Editor will move into the Copyediting stage.

The Copyeditor receives an email request from the Section Editor to copyedit a submission, which will then appear in the Copyeditor's Submissions queue. A Copyeditor who is unable to do the copyediting simply responds by email to the Section Editor.

A submission goes through three steps in the Copyediting stage.

1. **Initial Copyedit** is undertaken by Copyeditor.
2. **Author Copyedit** is when an author completes the edits made by the Copyeditor and uploads the changes.
3. **Final Copyedit** is where a Copyeditor reviews the submission a final time and uploads the final document.
