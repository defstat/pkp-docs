# الفصل 2: التنصيب والترقية

OPS 3 is a PHP web application with standardized install and upgrade processes. These processes are kept as simple as possible, though some general systems administration experience is recommended.

Up-to-date OPS system requirements, as well as installation, upgrade, and configuration instructions can be found in the following locations:

* in the package you downloaded from the [OPS download page](https://pkp.sfu.ca/ops/ops_download/) (look in the `docs/` directory);
* in the technical [How to Upgrade Guide](/dev/upgrade-guide/);
* Directly in the online [README file](https://github.com/pkp/ops/blob/main/docs/README.md) or [UPGRADE](https://github.com/pkp/ops/blob/main/docs/UPGRADE.md) documents; and
* in the PKP [Administrator's Guide](/admin-guide/).

For those who want to install from source via Git, instructions can be found directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/pkp/ops).
