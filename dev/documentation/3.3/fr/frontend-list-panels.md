# List Panels


Many of the [ListPanel](/dev/ui-library/dev/#/component/ListPanel) components are as complex as a small application. They allow the user to add, edit and delete items, perform faceted searches, navigate through paginated lists, and more.

The most complex ListPanels provide a helper class to configure and display them on the page.

Each ListPanel extends the base class, defines configurable props as public properties, and implements a `getConfig()` method that compiles all required props into an associative array.

```php
namespace PKP\components\listPanels;

class PKPAnnouncementsListPanel extends ListPanel {

    /** @var string URL to the API endpoint where items can be retrieved */
    public $apiUrl = '';

    /** @var int How many items to display on one page in this list */
    public $count = 30;

    /**
     * @copydoc ListPanel::getConfig()
     */
    public function getConfig() {
        \AppLocale::requireComponents(LOCALE_COMPONENT_PKP_MANAGER);
        \AppLocale::requireComponents(LOCALE_COMPONENT_APP_MANAGER);

        // Call ListPanel::getConfig() to compile common props
        $config = parent::getConfig();

        // Assign props that have been configured for this object
        $config['apiUrl'] = $this->apiUrl;
        $config['count'] = $this->count;

        // Assign required props that do not need to be configured,
        // such as translated strings
        $config['addAnnouncementLabel'] = __('grid.action.addAnnouncement');
        $config['deleteAnnouncementLabel'] = __('manager.announcements.deleteAnnouncement');

        return $config;
    }
}
```

In a `PageHandler`, create a new instance of the ListPanel and pass in the configuration props.

```php
$listPanel = new \PKP\components\listPanels\PKPAnnouncementsListPanel(
    'announcementsListPanel',
    __('announcement.announcements'),
    [
        'apiUrl' => $request->getDispatcher()->url(...),
        'count' => 20,
    ]
);
```

Then call the `getConfig()` method and pass the props to the `TemplateManager` as state.

```php
$templateMgr = TemplateManager::getManager($request);
$templateMgr->setState([
    'components' => [
        $listPanel->id => $listPanel->getConfig(),
    ],
]);
```
