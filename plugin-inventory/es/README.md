# About Plugins

## Introducción

The plugin inventory brings together links to existing plugin documentation for OJS/OMP/OPS. This list is not exhaustive and will continue to be updated as more plugin guides become available. All plugins on this list should be compatible with OJS/OMP/OPS 3.2+. For compatibility details, see the [live plugin gallery list on GitHub](https://github.com/pkp/plugin-gallery/blob/main/plugins.xml), a list of compatible plugins for possible installation with version listing.

### Plugin gallery vs external plugins

The OJS/OMP/OPS built-in Plugin Gallery provides access to externally-created plugins that may not be included in your OJS/OMP/OPS installation, but are available for download and activation. Only an Administrator can install a new plugin. For a full list of plugins included in the Plugin Gallery consult the [live plugin gallery list on GitHub](https://github.com/pkp/plugin-gallery/blob/main/plugins.xml).

Sometimes new plugins or plugins that are developed by users or contributors outside of PKP will not appear in the Plugin Gallery and you need to install them separately. For more details on how to do that consult the [External Plugins section of the Learning OJS guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/settings-website#external-plugins).

### Find a plugin compatible with your software version

The best way to identify and install a plugin compatible with your version of OJS/OMP/OPS is from within the platform’s Plugin Gallery. The Plugin Gallery will only show plugins compatible with your version and will refresh automatically to reflect the plugins added to the [live plugin gallery list on GitHub](https://github.com/pkp/plugin-gallery/blob/main/plugins.xml).

Another useful tool for checking plugin version compatibility at a glance is the [PKP Plugin Compatibility utility](https://pkp.github.io/plugin-compatibility/index.html).

For external plugins that do not appear in the [live plugin gallery list](https://github.com/pkp/plugin-gallery/blob/main/plugins.xml), consult the plugin developer’s GitHub page to determine compatibility. These plugins will need to be installed manually.

> **IMPORTANT:**  Installing a plugin that is not compatible with your OJS/OMP/OPS version can seriously impact software functionality. Installing the compatible version from the Plugin Gallery is the best way to prevent technical issues.

## Contribute a plugin

If you have developed a plugin, contributing it to the Plugin Gallery is the best way to make it automatically available for OJS/OMP/OPS users to install. See instructions on how to do this in the [Plugin Gallery readme page](https://github.com/pkp/plugin-gallery).

If your plugin is not available for the Plugin Gallery but you would like to have it included in the inventory below, [edit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-docs/tree/plugin-inventory/plugin-inventory) or send this information via [Documentation Feedback](https://pkp.sfu.ca/documentation-feedback/). Make sure the plugin is compatible with OJS/OMP/OPS 3.2+. Plugins not in the Gallery will be marked as “unvetted” on the list.
